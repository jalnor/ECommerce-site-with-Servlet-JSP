        <p>I received an Associate of Science degree from Fayetteville Technical Community
            college in 2015. I am a computer science major at the University of North Carolina
            at Charlotte focusing in software engineering and should graduate with a Bachelor's 
            of Science degree in 2018. I am also in the early entry Masters of Information Technology.</p>
        <p>I create this web site as part of an assignment in network based application development. It is 
            a mock computer sales site where I am learning Java servlets and jsps. I am looking forward to 
            enhancing the functionality of this site and to be able to incorporate what I learn here into 
            future projects.</p>
